# Seattle Trivia

How much do you know about the Emerald City? Test your knowledge with Seattle Trivia! The catch? You only have 120 seconds to answer 10 questions. No time for google, so do a couple jumping-jacks to warm up and then jump right into this game! 

## How to play: 
When the page downloads, you will be presented with a start button. Once clicked, the 120 second timer will begin counting down. Read through the questions and use the radio buttons to select your answer. Once time is up, you will be brought to a new page showing how you did including how many questions you got correct, how many you got wrong, and how many went unanswered. Want to know the answers to the questions you missed? You’ll have to play another round until you’ve learned them all!

## Components Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* GoogleFonts

## Feedback:
This game is deceptive. It looks so simple, but coming up with the JavaScript to make the buttons interact properly (only one guess per question, knowing which answer is correct, counting incorrect and unanswered questions) was challenging to work through. I would have liked to do the more complicated version where you have one question at a time with a different picture in between as well as an answer key, and given more time I would have, but for having a couple of days to build this I am just pleased that everything that was supposed to work does!
